Bit manipulation
/*bitwise operators used in bit or binary are*/
1. AND(&)
takes two bits
results  is 1 when both biths are 1.

2. OR (|)
Takes two bits
results is 0 when both bits are 0

3. NOT(~)
is a unary operators
results complement(opposite) of each bit

4. LEFT SHIFT(<<)
shifts bits towards left based on number of shifts placed
example:
var << 1
var is name of variable and represents bits to be shifted
1 is number of places to shift the bits
note: left shifting == multiplication by 2^right operand

5. RIGHT SHIFT(>>)
shifts bits towards right
example:
var >> 3
note: right shifting == division by 2^right operand
